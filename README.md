## Overview

Are you a Kanye fan? Do you love, love, LOVE the holidays? Well, this is the app for you! Introducing **Yuletide Yeezy**. Your one stop shop for generating holiday cards with original Kanye West quotes and festive Kanye West photos.

**Yuletide Yeezy** was built with React, and uses the [Kanye Rest API](https://api.kanye.rest) to generate the random Kanye quotes. This project is the final solo project of Mod3 at [Turing](turing.edu) and the original spec can be found [here.](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html) The project learning goals were to build and design an app using React, React Router, a third party API, and testing with Cypress. We were asked to come up with a super niche idea, so here you have it, a Kanye quote and image holiday card generator.

### Learning Goals

To demonstrate the understanding of:

- React fundementals
- Modular code and component structure
- React Router to create a multi-page application
- Cypress testing to test the application end-to-end
